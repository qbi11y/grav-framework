cloudMatrix is built using Twitter Bootstrap. This allows the styling of cloudMatrix to be easily updated to accommodate customization requests. While there are numerous variables within Twitter Bootstrap that can be adjusted, the actual number of variables exposed for customizations has been limited. Currently only colors and fonts have been exposed and are supported. Customizations outside of these realms are not supported and the outcome can not be verified.

To use the cloudMatrix Theme Generator, ensure you have a LESS compiler installed. Open the gravitant-toolkit-alt.less file. Update the exposed LESS variables to reflect the new desired theme. Save the LESS file and compile the document into a CSS file. The resulting CSS file will be used in place of the default cloudMatrix theme.
